# CRUDWebApp
First, you need a server that enables you to connect to your localhost.
Install the WampServer. Make sure that it will turn green. (If it is red or orange, you need to fix something in order to get started.)
Make sure that the php codes for your CRUD web application must work on your localhost. The directory will be on "www".
Open a browswer and type in "localhost" or "localhost/index.php" then it will show the output of your web application. 
You can Create, Add, Edit, and Delete something from your database. 
When your output runs successfully, you finally have your own running Web Application.
